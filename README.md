# Stadium-Bowl-Entourage-Automation
A Process that helps create entourage on stadium seats. 
It relies on seating models, typically from Revit, and converts them to a number of groups of nodes that are replaceable with people in Lumion.

The main process can be done in either Sketchup (Ruby) or Rhino 3D (Python). 
Currenty, the Ruby script for the former one is more developed.
